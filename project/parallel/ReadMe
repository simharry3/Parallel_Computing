Project ReadMe

This readMe is for anyone using the Diffustion Limited Aggregation project for parallel computing. 
the parallelPlane iteration.

Compiling on a laptop:
all: types.h types.c operations.h operations.c simulation.c 
	mpicc -I. -Wall -O3 *.c -o simulation

Arguements (on a laptop):
mpirun -np <number of ranks> simulation <number of particles> <world size> <number of steps (-1 for full run through)> <checkpoint file print frequency> <human vs robot output> <aggregator file>

Compiling on AMOS:
all: types.h types.c operations.h operations.c simulation.c 
	mpixlc -I. -Wall -O3 *.c -o simulation.xl

Arguements (on a laptop):
srun -np <number of ranks> simulation.xl <number of particles> <world size> <number of steps (-1 for full run through)> <checkpoint file print frequency> <human vs robot output> <aggregator file>

STRUCT INFORMATION:

typedef struct particle{
    int x; - x position of the particle
    int y; - y position of the particle
    int z; - z position of the particle
    int id; - id of the particle
    int collision; - collisiont value of the particle
    //ADD PARTICLE 
}particle;

typedef struct context{
    uint numParticles; - number of particles for the MPI_Rank
    int numSteps; - number of overall steps taken (used for a -1 timestep)
    int chkFreq; - the checkpoint frequency command to print to the checkpointFile
    int humanOutput; - the human output flag

    int* max; - the size informatino of the universe
    char* checkpointFile; - the chekpoint file name (unused)
}context;

typedef struct state{
    uint activeParticles; - number of active particle for this MPI_Rank
    uint collidedParticles; - number of collided particle for this MPI_Rank
    uint simSteps; - the current system step
    uint comm_size; - the MPI_Commsize
    particle* ptab; - an array holding all free particle information
    particle* ctab; - an array holding all colided particle information
    //ADD STATE
}state;

OTHER INFORMATION: NOTE THIS IS NOT THE VERSION WE WANT YOU TO RUN. THERE ARE EXTREME MEMORY LEAKS WITH THIS VERSION. PLEASE RUN EITHER THE SERIAL VERSION (IF YOU ARE TRYING TO RUN A NON PARALLEL ITERATION) OR PARALLEL PLANES (FOR A PARALLEL VERSION)
